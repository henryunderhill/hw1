A job I think is related to data science is a meteorologist<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology>. I believe looking at *weather trends*, viewing **historical data** correlated with times during the year and seasons utilizes data science to a major degree. Observing specific traits of a climate and how the weather affects certain areas utilizes methodology similar to what we use in statistics and data science.
